### What I'm working on:

I'm working on a GUI thingy with `egui` that I'm going to use to visualize a region file so I can move sectors around by hand to imagine how the algorithm will work. This will be a little annoying to make because `egui` can be a bit of a pain to work with, but I'll get it working how it needs to work.

So far, I have a struct called `FileSim` that holds a `Vec<Sector>`, and `Sector` is a custom struct that I made that includes an ID.

```rs
pub struct Sector {
	pub start: u32,
	pub end: u32,
	id: Id,
}

pub struct FileSim {
	sectors: Vec<Sector>,
}
```

So the next step is to turn `FileSim` into a `Widget` that can be drawn and iteracted with in `egui`. This should be fun. I've already been doing some experiments with how I want the widget to look.

Here's an example of a sector with a size of `3`:

Now that I have the visual style worked out, I just need to write the code to make it interactable.
My plan is to make it so that I can drag from the left or right side to change the size, and then I can drag from the middle to move it. While moving the sector, it will show you a preview of where the sector will end up if you drop it. The sector will also be drawn under the mouse while it is being dragged. I'm not sure how to work that part out since it needs to be popped up, but I'll have to do some research.

##### After some research

Okay, so after doing a little digging, I think I may have found a way to pop the preview out above everything else. I just need to register some kind of layer thing. 

...work in progress... If you see this, that means that I pushed the changes to view a preview.
