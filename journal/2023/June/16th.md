### What I'm working on:

I'm working on a GUI thingy with `egui` that I'm going to use to visualize a region file so I can move sectors around by hand to imagine how the algorithm will work. This will be a little annoying to make because `egui` can be a bit of a pain to work with, but I'll get it working how it needs to work.

So far, I have a struct called `FileSim` that holds a `Vec<Sector>`, and `Sector` is a custom struct that I made that includes an ID.

```rs
pub struct Sector {
	pub start: u32,
	pub end: u32,
	id: Id,
}

pub struct FileSim {
	sectors: Vec<Sector>,
}
```

So the next step is to turn `FileSim` into a `Widget` that can be drawn and iteracted with in `egui`. This should be fun. I've already been doing some experiments with how I want the widget to look.

Here's an example of a sector with a size of `3`:

...work in progress... If you see this, that means that I pushed the changes to view a preview.
