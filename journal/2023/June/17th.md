### What I'm working on:
> I'm writing a little script in Python to generate Journal entries for me. And I'll probably also use the script to publish the entries. I'm procrastinating on my main project a bit, but that's healthy to do if you're working on a big project.
### Entry:
In order to generate a journal entry template that I can fill in with my journal entry, I needed to be able to display the date. The way I wanted to display the date would include the ordinal suffix on the day of the month, because I think it looks nice, but I wasn't sure if that was already built into the standard library, so I just implemented my own solution because it was a simple and fun problem to solve.

Here's what my template looks like (with some filler):

```
So I needed to be able to take an integer, `17`, and get the suffix, `th`. I set out to write the following function:
```py
def get_ordinal_suffix(n: int)->str:
    """Gets the ordinal suffix of a number.
    
    This is also called the ordinal indicator.
    It is the `st` on `1st`, the `nd` on `2nd`, and the `rd` on `3rd`."""
    match n:
        # Special case for 11th, 12th, and 13th so you don't get 11st, 12nd, and 13rd, lol.
        case n if n >= 11 and n <= 13:
            return 'th'
        case n:
            match n % 10:
                case 1:
                    return 'st'
                case 2:
                    return 'nd'
                case 3:
                    return 'rd'
                case _:
                    return 'th'
```
It utilizes Python's powerful match statement to easily get the suffix. Like I said, very simple problem with a simple solution.

###### *A short time later*
I realized that I wanted people to be able to view a sort of table of contents for my journal, so I'm working on making that very thing. I'm going to integrate managing the table of contents into the Python script that I'm working on right now. I'd also like to work on making a GUI application that I can use to compose my journal entries, and even submit those entries. I might even separate my journal into a separate repository. But it would make sense for me to keep this journal in this repository since this is the one that I'm working on, and I'd like for people to get a look into what is going on behind the scenes as I develop this large piece of software.

So shall we have a preview of what the June calendar may look like?
